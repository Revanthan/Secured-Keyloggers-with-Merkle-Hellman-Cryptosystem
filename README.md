# Secured-Keyloggers-with-Merkle-Hellman-Cryptosystem
I have proposed a key logger software which helps to record each and every key press and stores it locally in the system without being identified by the user. For safety purpose the data of the keystroke is converted by Merkle Hellman cryptosystem so that even if user finds the file he/she won’t be able to find that those data’s are his/her keystrokes. It is so easy to operate, efficient and it captures all keyboard typed keystrokes.
